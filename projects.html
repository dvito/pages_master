        <h3>Nepalese Election</a></h3>
        <p>The 2013 Nepalese elections were a full of political turmoil, and it was a desire for many to make
        the information on the results as available as possible to the public.  <a href="http://www.datanepal.com">DataNepal</a>
        was able to provide quickly updated election results through the day utilizing data from the folks at <a href="http://www.himalkhabar.com/">Himal Media</a></p>

        <h3>Healthcare.gov Plan Finder</h3>
        <p>Plan Finder was the precursor to the modern healthcare.gov market places.  I worked on the development of the front end
        interface that users could use to look up healthcare plan information and contact providers to obtain coverage.  I also
        developed the API that is still used today by several companies to gain access to update information on healthcare plans.</p>

        <h3>Flu Vaccination Map</h3>
        <p> The Flu Vaccination Map was a project to make flu vaccination data available to the public in an easy to use format.  It included information on demographic disparities
        between various public groups.  Data was made available on the state, county, and
        zip code level.  The data was available in a visual format, a table format, as well as a JSON api.</p>
