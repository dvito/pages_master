    <p>I'm a web/mobile developer that enjoys working on web development projects of all scales,
      focusing on APIs, nice visualizations, and quick implementations. My current company has me
      moving between a lot of projects month to month and I tend to get a lot of experience with a
      ton of small apps that are part of bigger pictures.</p>
    <p>Check out some of my projects <a href="../projects.html">here</a>.
    <p>My background includes Masters and Bachelors Degrees of Science in Computer Science.  I'm familiar with a wide
    variety of technologies and platforms, some of which are listed below but I'm always willing
    to put some new tools in the shed.</p>

    <p>I play a lot of video games, be it anything from RPGs to Madden.  Its a welcome distraction
    when I get home and need to stop thinking about HTTP connections.  I actually got into Computer Science
    because of video games, only to quickly learn that games programming, though interesting, wasn't really
    what I was interested in doing.</p>
    <p>I've also been brewing a lot of beer in my free time.  It started as
    interest in the beer making process. It quickly morphed into a desire to "save some money"
    on beer because "its so easy!".  I've since spent more money than I care to think about slowly
    upgrading the operation.</p>
